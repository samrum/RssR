# RssR: Rss Feed Notifier

A chrome extension that grabs the headlines of RSS feeds, notifies the user of new articles, and displays them in an easily accessible way.
Created in response to other extensions I've used injecting ads and generally being unsavory.

RSS feeds are updated every 15 minutes.
Clicking a headline from the popup opens the article in a new tab without closing the popup window. Middle-clicking closes the popup window and opens the article in the current tab.
